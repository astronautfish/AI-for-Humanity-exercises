# Notes
Just some personal notes.

## Virtual environment

- To activate the virtual environment from the .venv folder, use `source .venv/bin/activate`

- To check where the python environment is running from write: `which python`. Double check whether it runs from the virtual environment.

- To add dependencies use `uv add 'package'`. It is added to the 'pyproject.toml' file.

## VIM commands
- Use ESC to type in commands. Write ':wq' to save and quit. (Useful when using 'git commit' without -m argument).
- Use ':q!" to quit and throw away changes (aborts commit).
